# Stackoverflow with MongoDB

In this project, we implement a simple application like stackoverflow.com with MongoDB. The purpose of this project is to test a real simple application in some test levels.
To test this application, we use acceptance-test criteria. And we use activity-diagram as our software artifact.
Full documentation related artifacts will be in the docs directory, in the root of the project. The documents are the activity diagram and the test report.
The tests of this project will automate with Jenkins and Docker.
